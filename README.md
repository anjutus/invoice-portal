## General Information
Invoice Portal is automated system for generating and processing invoices.A supplier can create a invoice and get the details of his invoices.A buyer can view the invoices he received and approve or reject them.Its my first project where I wanted to learn implementing front end and backend together,with simple CRUD operations.Invoices seemed like  a good topic to start as it requires less heavy UI element and data operations.I will also be implementing Login and Authorization using Auth0.

I have connected my GitHub to Cloudflare where Invoice Portal application is deployed using Cloudflare Pages.
